Review From Shelby:
•	One thing I would change is to move the Yale Art logo from the bottom left to the top left, where the animated icon is. Then maybe add the apply now and Login button to the top right of the page. 
•	Another option would be to remove the Apply Now button on the top since there is also an Apply link at the top and keep the login button at the bottom of the page. 
•	The only other thing I would consider changing is maybe adding a background color?  Or changing the clickable links be another color.
Changes Made: 
I moved the APPLY NOW to the top right with the paint swatch. I changed the apply in menu to “Application Process” ( only containing info about the process) and I moved the text in the footer to the middle so that it could be seen better. I didn’t add a background but I did apply a menu box so that it was clear it was navigation
